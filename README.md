# Python Recommender System

Exploring several approaches to building powerful recommendation systems with python.

In the notebook attached, I have explored building different types of recommendation systems which includes:
1. Simple recommendation based on popularity
2. Knowledge-based recommender systems
3. Content-based filtering recommender systems
4. Collaborative filtering  based recommender systems using:
- meaning rating
- weighted mean rating
- KNN model with surprise
- SVD model with surprise
5. Deep learning based recommender systems with pytorch and torch-lightning

## About Data
I used [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from kaggle which contains several csv files that helps serve our needs.

## What next?
I plan to go beyond notebook and build an API and an interactive website that utilizes the insights gained from the notebook
